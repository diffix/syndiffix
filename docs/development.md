## Development

Prerequisites: [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

- Installation: `poetry install`

Activate `poetry` environment: `poetry shell`. (can skip, then prepend `poetry run` to the following commands)

- Format: `black . && isort .`
- Test: `pytest .`
- Check: `flake8 . && mypy . && black --check . && isort . --check`

 To filter out acceptable lines:
     `poetry run flake8 . | findstr /v "E501" | findstr /v "F405" | findstr /v "F403"`

### Creating a new release

First, update the project's version by editing the `[tool.poetry]` section from the `pyproject.toml` file.
Then, create a new commit with the previous change and tag it with the new version. Afterwards, push everything to GitHub:

```sh
git add pyproject.toml
git commit
git push
git tag vX.Y.Z # Replace X.Y.Z with the new version.
git push -tag
```

Once the new tag is pushed to GitHub, the release publishing workflow should start running automatically
(but, depending on the repository settings, you might also need to approve its execution manually).

If using a branch, don't forget to merge the version field change into the `main` branch.

Note that once a release has been published successfully it can't be published again, even if deleted from PyPI.
